GIT FLOW:

  `git fetch --all`
3. After you have fetched the origin be sure to checkout the dev branch.
  `git checkout dev`

7. Type:
  `git branch` and then name the branch whatever you feel is appropriate, for example `git branch feature/Jumping`
8. After you make this branch you will want to checkout this branch and begin making changes.

10. You should now be on your newly created branch and ready to do your thing.
